These are the source files for Niall 0.2.0a, released under the GNU Public License.  It's not the nicest source in the world because Actor was very much a 'learning VB' program for me - so large amounts of the code have evolved as I've become more familiar with it.  This is also my explanation for some of the incredibly badly written stuff :)

If you can't get the VBP file to open properly in the VB environment feel free to e-mail me so we can try to resolve the problem.  Knowing VB, there are all kinds of little difficulties which I would only be too happy to resolve.

Please ignore the CVS directories.  These are a by-product of using the CVS system and I'm too lazy to weed them out...   There will be no effect on the program if you delete them.

This version of the program was written with VB5.  The helpfiles were created with Microsoft's Help Workshop which can be downloaded from

There are also many other excellent help associated programs and files on the www.helpmaster.de site


Any questions/comments/etc. about the source feel free to e-mail me.
